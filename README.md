## Core Modules

- 📊 **Analyzer Agent** — token scans, anomaly detection, contract risk evaluation  
- 👀 **Wallet Observer Agent** — whale tracking, wallet clustering, suspicious flow mapping  
- 📡 **Signal Agent** — alert streams, sentiment monitoring, media-triggered indicators  
- 💧 **Liquidity Agent** — pool depth scans, liquidity pressure analysis, swap flow monitoring  
- 🛠 **Custom Agent Builder** — assemble tailored stacks for your trading or research workflow
